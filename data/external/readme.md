## Effort ratings
Effort ratings for the four conditions were obtained after all SNRs were identified in the behavioural session. At the fixed SNR levels, one list of 16 sentences was used to obtain effort ratings for each of the conditions using the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion (Borg, 1982). The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion (Borg, 1982) was formulated to measure perceived physical effort, and has been used in research settings to examine listening effort during speech-in-noise assessments (H?llgren, Larsby, Lyxell, & Arlinger, 2005; Larsby, H?llgren, Lyxell, & Arlinger, 2005).The scale is ranked one through ten, with one being 'Nothing at all', and ten being 'Very very hard (maximal). The order in which the conditions were presented were randomised across participants. 

## BrainGauge Assessment 
The BrainGauge Assessment is a 15 minute assessment of cognitive load developed by the National Information Communication Technology Australia (NICTA) (Khawaja, Chen, Owen, & Hickey, 2009). The assessment comprises 7-mini web-based tests that assess verbal reasoning, numeric reasoning, speed of processing, and memory span using real-time speech detection software to detect when an individual is under high cognitive load. Cognitive load is assessed by measuring changes in the vocal tract through formant frequency analysis. 
The BrainGauge Assessment was administered on a laptop in a quiet room. Participants were informed to follow the instructions given verbally by the online assessment. The participants were free to move on to the next mini-game at their leisure until the assessment was completed. The BrainGauge software then automatically calculated the percentage score out of 100. 

## KIPS cognitive test battery
The KIPS test is a 20 minute assessment of cognition developed by Lyxell, S?derberg and  Olsson (2007). The assessment comprises 4 subtests that assess, speed of verbal processing, phonological representations, lexical speed, and working memory. 

The KIPS test was administered on a laptop and instructions were given verbally. Stickers with 'Y' for yes, and 'N' for no, were placed on the keys G and H respectively, and participants were asked to make their responses by pressing the Y or N key using their right hand only. Before each subtest, the participants had a warm-up test.

### Physical matching task
The aim of this subtest is to determine if two letters appearing on the laptop monitor look physically the same, or look different. For example, A-A (correct) or A-a (incorrect). This type of physical matching task measures processing speed (Posner & Mitchell, 1967). Reaction time data for correct answers only are used to calculate the score. 

### Lexical judgement task
The aim of this subtest is to determine whether a single word on the laptop monitor is a real word, or a non-word. For example, 'DOG' (correct) or 'DOJ' (incorrect). This type of lexical decision making task measures lexical access/ memory retrieval (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971). Reaction time data for correct answers only are used to calculate the score. 

### Rhyme judgement task
The aim of this subtest is to determine whether two words appearing on the laptop monitor rhyme with each other. For example 'Trough-Cough' (correct) or 'Rough-Dough' (incorrect) Some of the words are real words, and some are non-words. This task measures phonological representations (Baddeley & Wilson, 1985). Reaction time data for correct answers only are used to calculate the score. 

### Reading span task
Participants are presented with 2 x 3 sentences, 2 x 4 sentences, and 2 x 5 sentences, respectively. Each sentence comprises 3-5 words and are either normal sentences (e.g., The girl hugged the father), or absurd (e.g., The bear wrote poetry) and are grammatical or agrammatic. Sentences appear on the laptop monitor one word at a time and when the sentence is completed, there is a short pause and the participant is required to answer whether the sentence made sense or not by pressing the Y or N key. After a block of sentences were presented (e.g., 1 x 3 sentences), the participants were asked to repeat aloud either the first words (using the examples above, the correct answers would be 'The girl' and 'The bear', or the final words 'Hugged the father' and 'Wrote poetry'). These answers were then recorded by the examiner. The aggregate score of the entire task was then used to calculate the percentage out of 24. This task measures 'working memory or listeners' ability to process and store verbal information in a parallel task design (Ronnberg et al., 1989)"

## Victoria stroop test
The Victoria Stroop Test (VST) (Spreen & Strauss, 1998) is a brief standardised version of the original stroop task (Stroop, 1935). The test was administered using Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) Test Battery software (Mueller & Piper, 2014).
Participants were given a warm-up to familiarise them with the task. They were informed to use the keypad with their right hand only and to follow the instructions on the computer monitor. During the warm-up, participants were presented with coloured dots on the monitor and their corresponding key (e.g., the colour yellow had the corresponding key '3'), and were instructed to press the 3 when the colour was highlighted. 
The test comprises three sub-tasks, performed consecutively. The stimulus configuration always contains six rows, with four items per row. 
(1)	Coloured dots appear on the screen and participants select the key corresponding to the colour quickly as possible
(2)	Coloured words appear on the screen (non-colour words, e.g., and, hard, etc) and participants select the key corresponding to the colour quickly as possible
(3)	Coloured words appear on the screen (colour words, e.g., yellow, red, etc) and participants select the key corresponding to the colour quickly as possible, not the colour of the word (e.g., selecting red when the word green was written in red).
The PEBL software then automatically calculates and records the participant's summary score. The summary score is determined by calculating the errors in task 3. 
Shipley II- vocabulary
The Shipley II vocabulary task is a standardised test that was used to measure crystalised intelligence. The test comprises a 40-item vocabulary list where participants were required to identify what word in a list of 4 words had the closest meaning to the target word (e.g., x, x, x, x and the target word x). Participants were asked to circle the correct answer, which in the example above would be x. 
The summary score was calculated by adding the correct answers, and dividing this number into the total possible score (40). The scores were then standardised. 

## A short form of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale suitable for clinical use: The SSQ12
The SSQ12 is a shortened version of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ49) (Gatehouse & Noble, 2004) developed by Noble, Jensen, Naylor, Bhullar, and Akeroyd (2013). The scale is an assessment of hearing disability, with a focus on listening to speech in challenging conditions (e.g., You are in conversation with one person in a room where there are many other people talking. Can you follow what the person you are talking to is saying)? Participants answer by circling a number from 0 (not at all) to 10 (perfectly). The summary score was calculated by adding the answers, and dividing the answer into the total possible score (120).
